        <p><strong>About the Author:</strong><br>
        Ethan Wells is a writer, thinker, and advocate for emotional well-being, with a professional background in leadership and data-driven problem-solving. For close to two decades, he has worked at the intersection of technology and human systems, helping organizations navigate complexity and build resilience. But behind the success, Ethan struggled with the same challenges many of us face: self-doubt, negative thought patterns, and the weight of perfectionism.
	<br>
	His journey to overcome these challenges led him to explore the science of mindfulness, cognitive behavioral techniques, and habit formation. Through years of research, personal experimentation, and learning from others, Ethan discovered practical tools to break free from negativity and reclaim emotional balance. He wrote this book to share what he learned—not as a distant expert, but as someone who has walked the path himself.
	<br>
	Ethan holds advanced degrees in business and engineering, but his true passion lies in helping others find clarity and joy in their everyday lives. When he’s not writing, he enjoys hiking, exploring mindfulness practices, and spending time with his family in the Pacific Northwest.
	<br>
Ethan’s mission is simple: to offer readers actionable, evidence-based strategies to transform their relationship with negativity and build a life of purpose and resilience.</p>
